# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I made sure my code is functional and secure by writing unit tests that cover valid and invalid inputs, checking constraints like string lengths, formats, and unique IDs. I also use assertions to confirm that exceptions are thrown correctly when needed, so errors donâ€™t slip through. This testing approach helps prevent bugs and keeps the software stable and secure as it evolves.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I interpreted user needs by turning requirements into specific checks and test cases. For the Contact Service, I made sure things like ID length, name fields, and phone numbers matched what the user needed. Writing tests for these rules helped guide my code and made sure the program does exactly what the user expects.

# How do I approach designing software?
When designing software, I started with clear requirements and broke them into smaller tasks. I design classes and methods with clear roles and use unit tests to guide development and verify functionality. I keep a careful mindset to test edge cases and avoid shortcuts that could cause technical debt. This helps me deliver software that works correctly and is easy to maintain.
